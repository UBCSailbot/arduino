Arduino application version 1.0 and greater will not work with the APM code.

Use the Arduino application version 0023
from http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

Arduino application version 0023 requires manual installation of the arduino libraries we are using. To install, move the contents of the “libraries” folder to:
- Windows: it will likely be called "My Documents\Arduino\libraries". 
- Mac: it will likely be called "Documents/Arduino/libraries".
- Linux: it will be the "libraries" folder in your sketchbook.
